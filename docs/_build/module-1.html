  <p># Module 1: Mosaic image generation</p>
<p>Generating mosaics of remote sensing data from satellite data is the first step in our classifications. In this Module, you will learn how to navigate SEPAL and how to create mosaics using imagery from the Landsat or Sentinel satellites. At the end of this section, you will be able to create the satellite imagery mosaics you will need for Modules 2 &amp; 3.</p>
<p>This module should take you approximately 1-2 hours.</p>
<p>## Exercise 1.1: An introduction to SEPAL</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will be introduced to the SEPAL interface. You will learn how to access SEPAL’s features to facilitate the remote sensing exercises in later modules.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations! You have successfully completed this exercise. You now know how to navigate the SEPAL interface and access its many tools and functions.</strong></p>
<p>## Exercise 1.2: Mosaic generation (Landsat &amp; Sentinel 2)</p>
<p>SEPAL provides a robust interface for generating Landsat and Sentinel 2 mosaics. Mosaic creation is the first step for the image classification and two date change detection processes covered in Modules 2 and 3 respectively. These mosaics can be downloaded locally or to your Google Drive.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will create a Landsat mosaic for the Mai Ndombe region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where REDD+ projects are currently underway.</p>
<p>Objectives | Prerequisites

<dt>In the <strong>Date</strong> menu you can select the <strong>Year</strong> you are interested in or click on <strong>More.</strong></dt><dd><blockquote>
<div><p>1. This interface allows you to refine the dates or seasons you are interested in.
1. You can select a <strong>target date</strong> (The date in which pixels in the mosaic should ideally come from), as well as adjust the start and end date flags.
1. You can also include additional seasons from the past or the future by adjusting the <strong>Past Seasons</strong> and <strong>Future Seasons</strong> slider. This will include additional years’ data of the same dates specified. For example, if you’re interested in August 2015, including one future season will also include data from August 2016. This is useful if you’re interested in a specific time of year but there is significant cloud cover.
1. For this exercise, let’s create imagery for the dry season of 2019.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>1. Select July 1 of 2019 as your target date (2019-07-01), and move your date flags to May 1-September 30.

<div><p>1. When it is done, examine the preview to see how much data is available. For this example, coverage is good. However, in the future when you are creating your own mosaic, if there is not enough coverage of your area of interest, you will need to adjust your parameters.
1. To do so, notice the five tabs in the lower left. You can adjust the initial search parameters using the first three of these tabs. For example, Click on <strong>Dat</strong> to expand the date range if you would like.
1. The last two tabs are for <strong>scene selection</strong> and <strong>composite,</strong> which are more advanced filtering steps. We’ll cover those now.</p>
