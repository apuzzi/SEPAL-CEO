  <p># Module 4: Sample-based estimation of area and accuracy</p>
<p>Once you have either a land use/land cover (LULC) map (Module 2) or a change detection map (Module 3), the next step is to estimate the area within each LULC type or change type and the error associated with your map (this Module). All maps have errors, for example model output errors from pixel mixing or input data noise. Our objective is to create unbiased estimates of the area for each mapped category.
To do this, we will use sample-based estimations of area and error instead of ‘pixel counting’ approaches. Pixel counting approaches simply sum the area belonging to each different class. However, this doesn’t account for classification errors–for example, the probability that a pixel classified as wetland should be open water. Therefore, the pixel counting approach provides no quantification of sampling errors and no assurance that estimates are unbiased or that uncertainties are reduced (Stehman, 2005; GFOI, 2016).</p>
<p>Sample-based estimations of area and error create estimations of errors in pixel classification and use this to inform estimations of area. Therefore, sample-based estimations are in keeping with the IPCC General Guidelines (2006) that estimates should not be over- or under- estimates, and that uncertainty should be reduced as much as practically possible. For more information on the theory behind choosing sample-based estimations of area and error over pixel counting approaches, see:</p>

<p>There are four steps to sample-based estimation of area and accuracy. First, you will use the different classes in your LULC or change detection map to create a stratified sampling design in SEPAL using the Stratified Area Estimator (SAE) - Design tool (Exercise 4.1). Then you will revisit your response design and labelling protocols to use with data collection in CEO (Exercise 4.2). Finally, you will use data generated in CEO (Exercise 4.3) to calculate the sample-based estimates in SEPAL, using the Stratified Area Estimator- Analysis tool (Exercise 4.4). This tool quantifies the agreement between the validation reference points and the map product, providing information on how well the class locations were predicted by the Random forest classifier.</p>
<p>This process will provide two important outputs. First, you will have estimates of the area for each LULC or change type. Second, you will have a table that describes the accuracy for each LUC or change type. This is often called a confusion matrix. These may be final products for your projects. However, if you decide that your map is not accurate enough, this information can be fed back into the classification or change detection algorithms to improve your model.</p>
<p>This Module takes approximately 3 hours to complete.</p>
<p>## Exercise 4.1: Sample design and stratification</p>
<p>Stratified random sampling is an easy to use, easy to understand, and well supported sampling design (for more information, see Olofsson et al. 2014. Good practices for assessing accuracy and estimating area of land change, Remote Sensing of Environment 148, 42-57). With stratified random sampling, each class (e.g. land use, land cover, change type) is treated as a strata. Then, a sample is randomly taken from each sample, either in proportion to area, in proportion to expected variance, or in equal numbers across strata.
We will use the SEPAL SAE-Design tool. You will upload your classified map and set some basic parameters, then the SAE-Design tool will generate a set of stratified random points that are placed in each of the different land cover classes represented in your map. The number of points in each class will be scaled to the area each class covers in the map. The total sample size, the number of points used to validate the map will depend on your expected overall accuracy. Be sure to log these choices as part of your documentation (Module 5).</p>
<p>Objectives | Prerequisites

Generate a stratified random sample based on your image classification. | Classification from Module 2.
Optional: Upload your stratification to SEPAL. | Optional: you can also use your classification from Module 3.</p>
<p>### Part 0: Uploading files to SEPAL (optional)</p>
<p>If your classification is not stored in SEPAL (for example, a classification in GEE or a classification created through CODED), you will need to upload it to SEPAL in order to use SEPAL’s stratified random sample tool.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Login to SEPAL.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the purple wrench <strong>Apps</strong> button. If you have an existing tab open, you may need to click the <strong>plus</strong> sign in the top right.</p></li>

<p>### Part 1: Creating a stratified random sample</p>
<p>We will use SEPAL to create a stratified random sample. To begin, you can use the test dataset available in SEPAL or you can use a raster of your classification loaded into SEPAL using the instructions in Part 0.</p>
<p>If you have a large area you are stratifying, please first increase the size of your instance (see Module 1 Exercise 1.1 Part 5).</p>
<p>A well-prepared sample can provide a robust estimate of the parameters of interest for the population (percent forest cover, for example). The goal of a sample is to provide an unbiased estimate of some population measure (e.g. proportion of area), with the smallest variance possible, given constraints including resource availability. Two things to think about for sample design are: do you have a probability based sample design? That is, does every sample location have some probability of being sampled? And second, is it geographically balanced? That is, are all regions in the study area represented. These factors are required for the standard operating procedures when reporting for REDD+.
These directions will provide a stratified random sample of the proper sampling size.</p>

<p>&gt; When should you use CEO, and when should you use the CEO-SEPAL bridge? In general, <strong>the CEO-SEPAL bridge should only be used for very simple use cases.</strong> More specifically, CEO-SEPAL is a great option when you have only high-confidence categories, have a relatively small number of points, when you will collect the data yourself, and when the built in questions about your data points suffice. Most often, you will want to create a CEO project. Creating a CEO project through the collect.earth website is a better option when you have low-confidence categories, a larger number of points in your sample, when you want to use specific validation imagery, when multiple people will collect data and you need to track who is collecting data, and when you need more complex or custom questions about your data points.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>&gt; NOTE: CEO-SEPAL does not ask about low confidence categories–this is a problem for creating an error matrix if you have low-confidence categories.</p>

<p>1. When the project has been created, you can skip down to Exercise 4.2.
1. You can download a .shp file to examine your points in QGIS, ArcGIS, or another GIS program. You can also create a CEO project using a .shp file, however that is outside of the scope of this manual. Directions can be found in the Institutional manual found here: [<a class="reference external" href="https://collect.earth/support](https://collect.earth/support">https://collect.earth/support](https://collect.earth/support</a>).</p>
<p>### Part 2: Creating a CEO project via .csv</p>
<p>For projects with large sample sizes, where you want to have multiple people collecting validation data, or where you want to use specific validation imagery, you will want to create a project through CEO rather than through the CEO-SEPAL bridge. Note that the TOTAL number of plots you want to sample using a .csv must be 50,000 or less. If you have more plots, break it into multiple projects.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Make sure you have downloaded the .csv of your stratified random sample plots (Part 1).</p></li>
<li><p>Open your downloaded .csv file in Excel or the spreadsheet program of your choice.</p></li>
<li><p>First, make sure that your data doesn’t contain a strata of ‘no data’. This can occur if your classification isn’t a perfect rectangle, as seen in this example of Nepal (the red circles are samples that the tool created in the ‘no data’ area). <strong>If you have ‘no data’ rows, return to the SEPAL stratified estimator, and be sure to not include your no data class in the strata selection step.</strong></p>

<dt>Right now, your stratification is grouped by land cover type (<strong>map_class</strong> column). To reduce the human tendency to use the order of the plots to help identify them (ie. knowing the first 100 plots were classified forest, so being more likely to verify them as forest instead of determining if thats correct) we suggest first randomizing the order of the rows.</dt><dd><blockquote>

Each survey card creates a page of questions on the Data Collection interface.
1. The basic workflow is: Create new top-level question (new survey card) THEN populate answers THEN create any child questions &amp; answers THEN move to next top-level question (new survey card) &amp; repeat until all questions have been asked.
1. You can ask multiple types of questions (including the button—text questions from the Simple interface). You can also add survey rules in the Survey Rules Design panel.

<p>## Exercise 4.2: Data collection with data quality management approaches</p>
<p>Once you have created a stratified random sample, you will use CEO (or optionally the CEO-SEPAL tool) to visually interpret the land cover at the sample locations using a suitable source of reference data, often remote sensing data. These visual interpretations will then inform the area and error estimation (Exercise 4.3). However, to ensure accurate human interpretation of land cover, you will need to adopt data quality management approaches. Thus in this exercise, you will check your classification design (Part 1), plan your data collection (Part 2), collect your data (Part 3) and set up quality management (Parts 4 &amp; 5).</p>
<p>The reason for this focus on data quality is simple: area and error estimates are based on the human interpreter’s labelling of the sample; therefore, it is important that the labels are correct. Some recommend that three interpreters examine each unit independently, while other projects just have a subsample of the data points cross checked by another interpreter. In parts 4 &amp; 5, you will consider this and design a quality assurance plan that meets the needs and budgets of your specific mapping projects and management needs.
Much of this information is based on Standard Operating Procedures developed by Till Neeff at FAO for global application. Working these exercises will help you abide by these guidelines and meet these standards of quality for the data collected.</p>
<p>Objectives | Prerequisites
———–<a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">|</span></a>—————–
Understand how to set up a successful verification project. | Stratified random sample based on your image classification from Exercise 4.1.
Collect land cover verification data about each of your sample points. | CEO-SEPAL project initiated in Exercise 4.1.
Create quality management protocols for your verification project. |</p>
<p>### Part 1: Specify a classification scheme</p>
<p>“Classification scheme” is the name used to describe the land cover / land use classes adopted. It should cover all the possible classes that occur in interest. Just as when you are creating training data for your classification, you will need to have a response design with consistent labelling protocols when collecting data for your area and error estimates.</p>
<p>If you have already created a response design in Module 2, you should use that.</p>
<p>If you have not created a response design for the classification you are now evaluating, please refer to Exercise 2.1 to create a classification scheme. Note that if your classification was trained using training points that differ substantially from your classification scheme, you may need to collect new training data and re-run your classification.</p>
<p>As a reminder, our classification used to classify our Forest/Non-forest land cover map was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>![The classification tree.](images/classification_tree.JPG){:width=”450px”}</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We defined Forest as an area with over 70% tree cover. We defined Non-forest as areas with less than 70% tree cover. This captured land covers including urban areas, water, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>### Part 2: Planning data collection</p>
<p>Now that we have the framework for the procedure for data collection with quality in mind we can work through what it would be like setting up the process for a team. Data collection efforts require planning, particularly for large efforts with many interpreters involved. We will discuss these planning aspects here.</p>
<p>In this part, you will assume the role of a _coordinator_ and an interpreter for a small team working to validate the land cover classification from Module 2. A coordinator is responsible for organizing the team and tracking compliance information. An interpreter is responsible for collecting data.</p>
<p>Identify the reference data sources.</p>
<p>Ideally, you would have plots revisited in the field. However, this is rarely attainable given limited resources. An alternative is to collect reference observations through careful examination of the sample units using high resolution satellite data, or moderate resolution if high resolution is not available. The more data you have at your disposal the better.</p>
<p>If you have no additional data, you can use remote sensing data, such as Landsat data, for collecting reference observations, as long as the process to collect the reference data is more accurate than the process used to create the map being evaluated. Careful manual examination can be regarded as being a more accurate process than automated classification.</p>
<p>Consider what additional data you might be able to include in your verification. Do you have access to satellite data at a finer resolution than Landsat? Could you incorporate additional datasets such as stump data or on the ground verifications? You might try searching databases, such as [<a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/">https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/</a>).</p>
<p>In CEO, these are the additional data sources that you have added to your CEO project. The CEO-SEPAL bridge uses only the default imagery, which is currently Mapbox Satellite.</p>
<p>Compile a list of your data sources and review it with your interpreters. Recording this information is important for documentation (see Module 5).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>![A data source recording document.](images/data_source_recording_doc.JPG)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Determine level of effort.</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Estimate the necessary level of effort for the data collection using the following formula:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&gt; Minutes to interpret 1 sample unit * number of sample units = required level of effort for data collection</p>
<p>1. If information is available from previous inventories, use that experience to set the value on the time required for assessing sample units from previous experience using the same response design. Otherwise, carry out a test.
1. For this exercise, consider how long it took you to create your training data in Module 2 and use the formula above to estimate how long it will take to classify all your samples.</p>
<p><strong>Identify data collection participants.</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>As coordinator, you will identify the persons who may be involved in the data collection.

<p>In CEO, multiple interpreters can work on the same project at the same time. This makes it very easy to collect data collaboratively. When you later download the data, each interpreter’s email address will be attached to the point they collected. If you use CEO-SEPAL, you cannot collect this information at the time of writing.</p>
<p>### Part 3: Collecting data</p>
<p>After training and sample allocation, it is time to collect data. This can occur in the CEO-SEPAL interface (for smaller projects) or via CEO for larger or multi-user projects. Here, we will demonstrate collecting data in CEO to ensure compliance with SOP and oversight requiring interpreter names be collected for the points they collect, however the directions are largely the same for the CEO-SEPAL bridge.  How to set up a CEO project is discussed in Exercise 4.1 Part 2. How to set up a CEO-SEPAL project is discussed at the end of Exercise 4.1 Part 1.</p>
<p><strong>Data collection by interpreters.</strong></p>
<p>In general, data collection should include the following steps:
1. When interpreting the samples, use an interpretation key as a guide for assessing different land use classes and transitions. When possible, consult other interpreters and the coordinator if there are any doubts about the image interpretation.
2. The coordinator collects the data from all interpreters at defined intervals (intervals can be defined by number of samples or by time intervals) to perform quality assurance procedures, including auxiliary data checks, cold checks and hot checks, as defined in the quality assurance section.
3. During the data collection, the coordinator organizes regular discussions and group assessment of samples with all the interpreters to ensure a mutual understanding of the interpretation techniques.
4. Take notes of challenges and limitations during the data collection as well as potential sources of bias during the data collection. If working as part of a team of collectors pass this information along to the coordinator.</p>

<p>## Exercise 4.3: Area and uncertainty estimation</p>
<p>The final step of calculating the sample-based estimates of error and area is taking the map areas (generated in Exercise 4.1), and your verification data points from our data collection (Exercise 4.2), conducted according to the response design rules (Exercise 4.1) and using statistics to output the final estimates of area and uncertainty.</p>
<p>In Part 1, we provide an optional description of error matrices, also called confusion matrices. This provides the underlying theory for using the SEPAL “Stratified estimator–Analysis” tool to conduct the area and uncertainty estimation. This tool quantifies the agreement between the validation reference points and the map product, providing information on how well the class locations were predicted.
Please note that you will need to upload your collected data from CEO to Sepal using the directions found in Part 0 of Exercise 4.1. If you used the CEO-SEPAL bridge, you must log out of CEO for the “Import CEO Project” link to work.</p>
<p>Objectives | Prerequisites

Create area estimates for your classification | Completed verification data, or reference data (Exercise 4.2)
Create uncertainty/error estimates for your classification | Map areas generated by your sampling design (Exercise 4.1)</p>
<p>### Part 1: Understanding the error matrix (optional)</p>
<p>A common tool to quantify agreement is the error matrix (sometimes called a confusion matrix). The error matrix organizes the acquired sample data in a way that summarizes key results and aids the quantification of accuracy and area. This is a simple cross-tabulation that compares the (algorithm assigned) map category labels to the (human assigned) reference category labels (your validation classification). The count for each pairwise combination are included in the blue and yellow cells in the following example.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>![A confusion matrix example.](images/confusion_matrix_example.JPG)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The main diagonal of the error matrix (blue cells) includes the count of the number of correct classifications.</p></li>
<li><p>The off-diagonal elements (yellow cells) show map classification errors.</p></li>
<li><p>The user’s accuracy can be quantified by dividing the number of correctly classified plots by the sum of the plots classified as the mapped class. For the forest class in the example above, this is 17 correctly identified points divided by 19 total forest plots. User’s accuracies for each class are shown in the orange cells. User’s accuracy is the complement of errors of commission (sites that are classified as forest in the map, but are not actually forest).</p></li>
<li><p>The producer’s accuracy can be quantified by dividing the number of correctly classified plots by the sum of the plots classified as the mapped class in the validation reference sample. For the forest class in the example above, this is 17 correctly identified points divided by 20 samples that were classified as forest from the reference data. Producer’s accuracies for each class are shown in the pink cells. Producer’s accuracy is the complement of errors of omission (sites that are not classified as forest in the map that are actually forest).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For your own data, calculate an error matrix following the above guidelines:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>![An example error matrix](images/example_error_matrix.JPG)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Here’s a completed example for a project using 4 classes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>![Example error matrix for a 4 class project.](images/example_error_matrix_4class.JPG)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In this example, the user’s accuracy for Forest is 94.7%; so the error of commission is 5.3%. The user’s accuracy for water is 90%, which means the error of commission is 10%. What this means is that according to the reference data, the map creator mapped 5.3% of Forest land cover in the wrong class and 10% of water in the wrong class. The producer’s accuracy for Forest is 75%, meaning the error of omission is 25%. The producer’s accuracy for water is 90%, so the error of omission is 10%. This means that 25% of the forest reference samples were mapped in the wrong land cover class, while only 10% of water was mapped in the wrong class. Calculate the errors of omission and commission for Other and Cloud land cover classes.</p>
<p>Once the error matrix is created, the area estimation becomes straightforward. Essentially, we use the frequency of these errors of omission and commission for each map class to calculate updated map areas based on our knowledge of how likely each class is to be classified as something else. We can also calculate the uncertainties for the total area of each class.</p>
<p>At the heart of the analysis is the implementation of an unbiased area estimator. Different estimators can be implemented to assess accuracy. In the next part, you will use a stratified estimation since you have a sample stratified by the discrete map classes.</p>
<p>### Part 2: Preparing your CEO collected data for analysis in SEPAL (optional)</p>

These are the classes you assigned manually in CEO based on map imagery. This will either be numeric (1 or 2) or text (Forest and Non-forest) depending on how you set up your Collect Earth Online project.</p>

<p>### Part 3: Using the stratified estimator in SEPAL</p>
<p>The aim of this stratified sampling design tool is to analyze results from a stratified sampling design that can be used for area estimates. The idea is to combine a map (used as a stratification of the landscape of interest) with a visual map interpretation of samples to produce an area estimation.</p>
<p>The concept is derived from map accuracy assessment principles: characterized frequency of errors (omission and commission) for each map class may be used to compute area estimates and also to estimate the uncertainties (confidence intervals) for the areas for each class.</p>

In this exercise we collected validation data using a stratified sample, so the values we need to use are the stratified random values.
1. Need to define unbiased stratified random and direct estimate stratified random.
1. Note that the Map pixel count value differs from these stratified random sample estimates. This shows how using a map pixel count is a poor estimation of actual area.</p>
