  <p># Module 2: Image classification</p>
<p>The main goal of this Module is to construct a single-date land cover map by classification of a Landsat composite generated from Landsat images. Image classification is frequently used to map land cover, describing what the landscape is composed of (grass, trees, water, impervious surface), and to map land use, describing the organization of human systems on the landscape (farms, cities, wilderness). Learning to do image classification well is extremely important and requires experience. So here is your chance to build some experience. You will first consider the types of land cover classes you would like to map and the amount of variability within each class.</p>
<p>There are both supervised (uses human guidance including training data) and unsupervised (no human guidance) classification methods. The random forest approach used here uses training data and is thus a supervised classification method.</p>
<p>There are a number of supervised classification algorithms that can be used to assign the pixels in the image to the various map classes. One way of performing a supervised classification is to utilize a Machine Learning algorithm. Machine Learning algorithms utilize training data combined with image values to learn how to classify pixels. Using manually collected training data, these algorithms can train a classifier, and then use the relationships identified in the training process to classify the rest of the pixels in the map. The selection of image values (e.g., NDVI, elevation, etc.) used to train any statistical model should be well thought out and informed by your knowledge of the phenomenon of interest to classify your data (e.g., into forest, water, other, and clouds).</p>
<p>In this module, we will create a land cover map using supervised classification in SEPAL. We will train a random forest machine learning algorithm to predict land cover with a user generated reference data set. This data set is collected either in the field or manually through examination of remotely sensed data sources such as aerial imagery. The resulting model is then applied across the landscape. You will complete an accuracy assessment of the map output in Module 4.</p>
<p>Before starting your classification, you will need to create a response design with details about each of the land covers/land uses that you want to classify (Exercise 2.1); create mosaics for your area of interest (in Exercise 2.2 we will use a region of Brazil); and collect training data for the model (Exercise 2.3). Then, in Exercise 2.4 we will run the classification and examine our results.</p>
<p>The workflow in this module has been adapted from exercises and material developed by Dr. Pontus Olofsson, Christopher E. Holden, and Eric L. Bullock at the Boston Education in Earth Observation Data Analysis in the Department of Earth &amp; Environment, Boston University. To learn more about their materials and their work, visit their github site at [<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeoda](https://github.com/beeoda">https://github.com/beeoda](https://github.com/beeoda</a>).</p>
<p>At the end of this module you will have a classified land use land cover map.</p>
<p>This module takes approximately 4 hours to complete.</p>
<p>## Exercise 2.1: Response Design for Classification</p>
<p>Creating consistent labelling protocols is necessary for creating accurate training data and later, accurate sample based estimates (see Module 4). They are especially important when more than one researcher is working on a project and for reproducible data collection. Response design helps a user assign a land cover / land use class to a spatial point. The response design is part of the metadata for the assessment and should contain the information necessary to reproduce the data collection. The response design lays out an objective procedure that interpreters can follow and that reduces interpreter bias.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will build a decision tree for your classification along with much of the other documentation and decision points (for more on decision points, please see Module 5, Exercise 5.1).</p>
<p>Objectives | Prerequisites
————– | ——————-
Learn how to create a classification scheme for land cover land use classification mapping. | None</p>
<p>### Part 1: Specify the Classification Scheme</p>
<p>“Classification scheme” is the name used to describe the land cover and land use classes adopted. It should cover all of the possible classes that occur in the area of interest. Here, you will create a classification scheme with detailed definitions of the land cover and land use classes to share with interpreters.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Create a decision tree for your land cover or land use classes. There may be one already in use by your department.  The tree should capture the most important classifications for your study. Here is an example:</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p>1. This example includes a hierarchical component. For example, the green and red categories have multiple sub-categories, which might be multiple types of forest or crops or urban areas. You can also have classification schemes that are all one level with no hierarchical component.
1. For this Exercise, we’ll use a simplified land cover and land use classification as in the second image:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>![The classification scheme we will use for this exercise, with two classes forest and non-forest](images/classification_scheme.JPG){:width=”450px”}</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>When creating your own decision tree, be sure to specify if your classification scheme was derived from a template, including the IPCC land-use categories, CLC, or LUCAS.</dt><dd><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>If applicable, your classification scheme should be consistent with the national land cover and land use definitions. In cases where the classification scheme definition is different from the national definition, you will need to provide a reason.</p></li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Create a detailed definition for each land cover and land use and change class included in the classification scheme. We recommend you include measurable thresholds.</dt><dd><ol class="arabic simple">

<dt>Our classification will take place in Brazil, in an area of the Amazon rainforest undergoing deforestation.</dt><dd><p>1. We’ll define Forest as an area with over 70% tree cover.
1. We’ll define Non-forest as areas with less than 70% tree cover. This will capture urban areas, water, and agricultural fields.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><dl>
<dt>For creating your own classifications, here’s some things to keep in mind:</dt><dd><p>1. It is important to have definitions for each of the classes. A lack of clear definitions of the land cover classes can make the quality of the resulting maps difficult to assess, and challenging for others to use. The definitions you come up with now will probably be working definitions that you find you need to modify as you move through the land cover classification process. As you become more familiar with the landscape, data limitations, and the ability of the land cover classification methods to discriminate some classes better than others, you will undoubtedly need to update your definitions.
1. As you develop your definitions, you should be relating back to your applications. Make sure that your definitions meet your project objectives. For example, if you are creating a map to be used as part of your UNFCCC greenhouse gas reporting documents you will need to make sure that your definition of forest meets the needs of this application. The below image is an excerpt of text from the Methods and Guidance from the Global Forest Observations Initiative (GFOI) document that describes the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2003 Good Practice Guidance (GPG) forest definition and suggestions to consider when drafting your forest definition.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>When creating your own decision tree, be sure to specify if your definitions follow a specific standard, e.g., using ISO standard Land Cover Meta-Language (LCML, ISO 19144-2) or similar.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>During this online training course, you will be mapping land cover across the landscape using the Landsat composite, a moderate resolution data set. You may develop definitions based upon your knowledge from the field or from investigating high resolution imagery. However, when deriving your land cover class definitions, it’s also important to be aware of how the definitions relate to the data used to model the land cover. You will continue to explore this relationship throughout the exercise.</dt><dd><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Will the spectral signatures between your land cover categories differ? If the spectral signatures are not substantially different between classes, is there additional data you can use to differentiate these categories? If not, you might consider modifying your definitions.</p></li>

<p>## Exercise 2.2: Create mosaic for classification</p>
<p>We first need an image to classify before running a classification. For best results, we will need to create an optical mosaic with good coverage of our study area. We will build on knowledge gained in Module 1 to create an optical mosaic in SEPAL and retrieve it to Google Earth Engine.</p>
<p>In SEPAL you can run a classification on either a mosaic recipe or on a GEE asset. It is best practice to run a classification using an asset rather than on-the-fly with a recipe. This will improve how quickly your classification will export and avoid computational limitations.</p>

<p>## Exercise 2.3: Training Data Collection in CEO-SEPAL</p>
<p>In this exercise, we will learn how to collect training data using the CEO-SEPAL tool. These training data points will become the foundation of our classification in Exercise 2.4. High quality training data is necessary to get good land cover map results. In the most ideal situation, training data is collected in the field by visiting each of the land cover types to be mapped and collecting attributes. When field collection is not an option, the second best choice is to digitize training data from high resolution imagery, or at the very least from the imagery to be classified.</p>
<p>In this assignment, you will create training data points using a combination of high-resolution imagery and the Landsat composite. These will be used to train the classifier in a supervised classification using SEPAL’s random forests algorithm. The goal of training the classifier is to provide examples of the variety of spectral signatures associated with each class in the map.</p>

<p>### Part 1: Setting Up a Training Project</p>
<p>To collect training data, we will need to create a ceo-sepal project from within SEPAL. There are two ways to do this. The easier way is to begin the classification and follow a link when prompted. This is the approach we will use here.</p>
<p>However, you can also navigate to [<a class="reference external" href="https://sepal.io/ceo](https://sepal.io/ceo">https://sepal.io/ceo](https://sepal.io/ceo</a>), log in, and add a project directly through this interface (starting at Step 3a, below). If you use this route, you will need to create the classification later, using steps 1-3 below.</p>

1. Type in a unique name for your training dataset, such as “Amazon training data”.
1. Use <strong>TRAINING DATA</strong> as the <strong>Type.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>1. The <strong>Training Data</strong> option enables you to create a project from scratch. To use this method, you will need to identify a set of land cover classes to classify (code list) and you will need to add imagery that will be used to identify the types of land cover. You will then manually place your training data on the map and classify them.
1. <strong>CEP</strong> stands for Collect Earth Project and it contains a collection of training data points that have already been generated and just need to be classified based on the classes defined within the project. It typically contains a customized method for classifying training data that incorporates % cover.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>1. Once you select the training data option, you will notice a new parameter: <strong>Scale (m).</strong> This scale refers to the spatial resolution of the imagery you will be classifying to create your map product. Type in 30, as that is the spatial resolution of Landsat. This will create a plot that is 30 m by 30 m.
1. Click the <strong>+</strong> button to the right of the section that says <strong>Code List.</strong> When you click the <strong>+</strong> button, an empty row is added to the Code List. You need two rows.</p>

<p>### Part 2: Collect Training Data Points</p>
<p>Now that the CEO-SEPAL project is set up, you are ready to begin collecting data points for each land cover class. In most cases, it is ideal to collect a large amount of training data points for each class that capture the variability within each class and cover the different areas of the study area. However, for this exercise, you will only collect a small number of points: around 25 per class. When collecting data points, make sure that your plot contains only the land cover class of interest (no plots with a mixture of your land cover categories).</p>
<p>To help you understand why the random forest algorithm might get some categories you are trying to map confused with others, you will use spectral signatures charts in CEO-SEPAL to look at the NDVI signature of your different land cover classes. You should notice a few things when exploring the spectral signatures of your land cover classes. First, some classes are more spectrally distinct than others. For example, water is consistently dark in the NIR and MIR wavelengths, and much darker than the other classes. This means that it shouldn’t be difficult to separate water from the other land cover classes with high accuracy.</p>
<p>Second, not all pixels in the same classes have the exact same values—there is some natural variability! Looking at NDVI (and other vegetation indices) spectral signatures will help you begin to understand the inherent variability of your land cover classes. Capturing this variation will strongly influence the results of your classification.</p>

Therefore, it will be important that you focus on collecting a variety of points from different types of land cover throughout the study area.
1. <strong>Water</strong> is one of the easiest classes to identify and the easiest to model, due to the distinct spectral signature of water.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>1. Look for water bodies within your Landsat image. On your <strong>Landsat 8 SWIR</strong> image, they will appear black.
1. Collect 10-15 data points for Water and be sure to spread them throughout Lake Mai Ndombe, the water sources feeding into it, and a couple of the water bodies/rivers to the eastern side of the mosaic. Be sure to put 2-3 points on rivers.
1. Look at the Chart of NDWI and NDVI to see if the points you are classifying are covered in water year-round.
1. The spectral signature for water will be relatively low (0-0.4) when looking at the NDVI chart.
1. Some wetland areas may have varying amounts of water throughout the year, so it is important to check the time series charts. If you encounter areas that look like water but have seasonally high NDVI, place your point in a different area that has a more distinct water signature. It is ideal to give the classifier points that are homogenous and unambiguous.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations! You have successfully completed this exercise. You now know how to use SEPAL’s version of Collect Earth Online to create training data for a supervised classification.</strong></p>
<p>## Exercise 2.4: Classification Using Machine Learning Algorithms (Random Forests) in SEPAL</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>![The outcome of a random forest model](images/random_forest_model_outcome.JPG)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>As mentioned in the Module introduction, the classification algorithm you will be using today is called random forest.  The random forest algorithm creates numerous decision trees for each pixel. Each of these decision trees votes on what the pixel should be classified as. The land cover class that receives the most votes is then assigned as the map class for that pixel. Random forests are efficient on large data and accurate when compared to other classification algorithms.</p>
<p>To complete the classification of our mosaicked image you are going to use a random forests classifier contained within the easy-to-use Classification tool in SEPAL. The image values used to train the model include the Landsat mosaic values and some derivatives (such as NDVI). There are likely additional data sets that can be used to help differentiate land cover classes, such as elevational data. If that is the case, it would be good to load this into the project and include them in the model. Examples of additional data sets that would probably be quite helpful to differentiate classes include climatic and topographic (aspect, elevation) information.</p>
<p>After we create the map, you might find that there are some areas that are not classifying well. The classification process is iterative, and there are ways you can modify the process to get better results. One way is to collect more or better reference data to train the model. You can test different classification algorithms, explore object based approaches opposed to pixel based approaches, or be more creative with specifying the model predictor variables. In the case of being more creative with model predictor variables you can try using multiple dates of data (instead of a single date), or try using texture bands. The possibilities are many and should relate back to the nature of the classes you hope to map. Last but certainly not least is to improve the quality of your training data. Be sure to log all of these decision points in order to recreate your analysis in the future.</p>

<p>### Part 0: Merging Asset Tables (Optional)</p>
<p>To get a more accurate training dataset, consider combining multiple training datasets. For example, if you’re completing these exercises as part of a group training, try combining your training data set with your neighbors’. We will show you how to do this using your .csv files, however if you are more familiar with GEE you can also combine files using code in GEE.</p>

<p>### Part 2: QA/QC considerations and methods</p>
<p>Quality assurance and quality control, commonly referred to as QA/QC, is a critical part of any analysis. There are two approaches to QA/QC: formal and informal. Formal QA/QC, specifically sample-based estimates of error and area are described in Module 4. Informal QA/QC involves qualitative approaches to identifying problems with your analysis and classifications to iterate and create improved classifications. Here we’ll discuss one approach to informal QA/QC.</p>
<p>Following analysis you should spend some time looking at your change detection in order to understand if the results make sense. We’ll do this by adding your classification to the SEPAL-CEO project we created in Part 2. This allows us to visualize the data and collect additional training points if we find areas of poor classification. Other approaches not covered here include visualizing the data in Google Earth Engine or in another program, such as QGIS or ArcMAP.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Check your Google Earth Engine Assets for your retrieved Amazon Classification map. Copy the <strong>Image ID</strong> link.</p></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Navigate back to your SEPAL-CEO project at [<a class="reference external" href="https://sepal.io/ceo/](https://sepal.io/ceo/">https://sepal.io/ceo/](https://sepal.io/ceo/</a>).</dt><dd><blockquote>
<div><p>1. Next to your Amazon project, click on <strong>Edit.</strong>

<li><p>Switch the imagery to your Classification and pan and zoom around the map. Black will be ‘Forest,’ and white is ‘Non-forest’ pixels.</p></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Compare your Classification map to Landsat 8 imagery.</dt><dd><p>1. What land cover was classified correctly?
1. Where do you see errors on the map?
1. What classes seem to have the most error?
1. What do you think may have caused one class to be classified more accurately than another?</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p>If your results make sense, and you are happy with them, great! Go on to the formal QA/QC in Module 4.</p></li>
<li><p>However if you are not satisfied, collect additional points of training data where you see inaccuracies following the same process as in Exercise 2.3. Then re-run the classification following the steps in Part 1.</p></li>
