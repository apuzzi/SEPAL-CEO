  <p># Module 3: Image change detection</p>
<p>Image change detection allows us to understand differences in the landscape–or more correctly, in the satellite images taken of the landscape–over time. There are many questions that change detection methods can help answer, including “When did deforestation take place?” and “How much forest area has been converted to agriculture in the past 5 years?”</p>
<p>Most methods for change detection use algorithms backed by statistical methods to extract and compare information in the satellite images. To conduct change detection then, we need multiple mosaics or images, each one representing a point in time. Here, we will describe how to detect change between two dates using a simple model, however this theory can be expanded to include more dates. In addition, we’ll describe time series analysis, which generally looks at longer periods of time.</p>
<p>The objective of this module is to become associated with methods of detecting change for an area of interest using the SEPAL platform. This will build upon and incorporate what we have covered in the previous modules including: creating mosaics, creating training samples, and classifying imagery. This module is split into two exercises. The first addresses change detection using two dates, and the second more advanced methods using time series analysis with the BFAST algorithm and Landtrendr. At the end of this module you will know how to conduct a two-date change detection in SEPAL, have a basic understanding of the BFAST tool in SEPAL, and be familiar with TimeSYnc and LandTrendr.</p>
<p>This module should take you approximately 3 hours.</p>
<p>## Exercise 3.1: Two date change detection</p>
<p>In this Exercise, you will learn how to conduct a two-date change detection in SEPAL. The algorithm SEPAL uses …</p>
<p>To use this algorithm, you will first need to have two imagery derived classifications, one for each point in time. In this example, you will create optical mosaics and classify them, building on skills learned in Modules 1 and 2. Alternatively, you may also use two classifications from your own research area.</p>

<p>### Part 1: Create Mosaics for Change Detection</p>
<p>Before we can identify change, we first need to have images to compare. We will create two mosaics of Myanmar, generate some training data, and then classify the mosaics. This is discussed in detail in Module 1 &amp; 2.</p>

<p>### Part 2: Create &amp; Collect Change Classification Training Data</p>
<p>Now that we have the mosaics created, we will collect change training data. Though more complex systems can be used, we will consider two land cover classes that each pixel can be in 2015 or 2018: forest and non-forest. Thinking about change detection, we will use three options: stable forest, stable non-forest, and change. That is, between 2015 and 2018 there are four pathways: a pixel can be forest in 2015 and in 2018 (stable forest); a pixel can be non-forest in 2015 and in 2018 (stable non-forest); or it can change from forest to non-forest or from non-forest to forest. If you use this manual to guide your own change classification, remember to log your decisions including how you are thinking about change detection (what classes can change and how), and the imagery and other settings used for your classification.</p>

<p>### Part 4: QA/QC</p>
<p>Quality assurance and quality control, commonly referred to as QA/QC, is a critical part of any analysis. There are two approaches to QA/QC: formal and informal. Formal QA/QC, specifically sample-based estimates of error and area are described in Module 4. Informal QA/QC involves qualitative approaches to identifying problems with your analysis and classifications to iterate and create improved classifications. Here we’ll discuss one approach to informal QA/QC.</p>
<p>Following analysis you should spend some time looking at your change detection in order to understand if the results make sense. We’ll do this by adding your classification to the SEPAL-CEO project we created in Part 2. This allows us to visualize the data and collect additional training points if we find areas of poor classification. Other approaches not covered here include visualizing the data in Google Earth Engine or in another program, such as QGIS or ArcMAP.</p>

Learn the basics of BFAST explorer in SEPAL | SEPAL account.
Learn about time series analysis options outside of SEPAL |</p>
<p>### Part 1: BFAST Explorer</p>
<p>Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) is a change detection algorithm for time series which detects and characterizes changes. BFAST integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change within time series. BFAST iteratively estimates the time and number of changes, and characterizes change by its magnitude and direction (Verbesselt et al. 2009).</p>
<p>BFAST Explorer is a Shiny app, developed using R and Python, designed for the analysis of Landsat Surface Reflectance time series pixel data. Three change detection algorithms - bfastmonitor, bfast01 and bfast - are used in order to investigate temporal changes in trend and seasonal components, via breakpoint detection. If you encounter any bugs, please send a message to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:almeida&#46;xan&#37;&#52;&#48;gmail&#46;com">almeida<span>&#46;</span>xan<span>&#64;</span>gmail<span>&#46;</span>com</a>, or create an issue on the GitHub page.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>&gt; NOTE: Each BFSAT algorithm methodology has characteristics which affect when and why you may choose one over the other. For instance, if the goal of an analysis is to monitor when the last time change occurred in a forest then “Bfastmonitor” would be an appropriate choice. Bfast01 may be a good selection when trying to identify if a large disturbance event has occurred, and the full Bfast algorithm may be a good choice if there are multiple times in the time series when change has occurred.*</p>

<p>### Part 2: TimeSync and LandTrendr</p>
<p>Here we will briefly review TimeSync and LandTrendr, two options available outside of SEPAL that may be useful to you in the future. It is outside of the scope of this manual to cover them in detail but if you’re interested in learning more we’ve provided links to additional resources.</p>
<p><strong>TimeSync</strong></p>
<p>TimeSync was created by Oregon State University, Pacific Northwest Research Station, the Forest Service Department of Agriculture, and the USFS Remote Sensing Applications Center.</p>
<p>From the TimeSync User manual version 3:</p>
<p>&gt; “TimeSync is an application that allows researchers and managers to characterize and quantify disturbance and landscape change by facilitating plot-level interpretation of Landsat time series stacks of imagery (a plot is commonly one Landsat pixel). TimeSync was created in response to research and management needs for time series visualization tools, fueled by rapid global change affecting ecosystems, major advances in remote sensing technologies and theory, and increased availability and use of remotely sensed imagery and data products (Cohen et al., 2010).</p>
<p>TimeSync is a Landsat time series visualization tool (both as a web application and for desktops) that can be used to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Characterize the quality of land cover map products derived from Landsat time series.</p></li>
<li><p>Derive independent plot-based estimates of change, including viewing change over time and estimating rates of change.</p></li>
<li><p>Validate change maps.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore the value of Landsat time series for understanding and visualizing change on the earth’s surface.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>TimeSync is a tool that researchers and managers can use to validate remotely sensed change data products and generate independent estimates of change and disturbance rates from remotely sensed imagery. TimeSync requires basic visual interpretation skills, such as aerial photo interpretation and Landsat satellite image interpretation.”</p>
<p>From TimeSync’s Introduction materials, here is an example output:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>![An example from TimeSync](images/TimeSync_example.JPG)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For more information on TimeSync, including an online tutorial (for version 2 of TimeSync), go to:[ timesync.forestry.oregonstate.edu/tutorial.html]( timesync.forestry.oregonstate.edu/tutorial.html). There you can register for an account and work through an online tutorial with examples and watch a recorded TimeSync training session. You can also find the manual for version 3 of TimeSync here:[ <a class="reference external" href="http://timesync.forestry.oregonstate.edu/training/TimeSync_V3_UserManual_doc.pdf">http://timesync.forestry.oregonstate.edu/training/TimeSync_V3_UserManual_doc.pdf</a>]( <a class="reference external" href="http://timesync.forestry.oregonstate.edu/training/TimeSync_V3_UserManual_doc.pdf">http://timesync.forestry.oregonstate.edu/training/TimeSync_V3_UserManual_doc.pdf</a>), and an introductory presentation here: [<a class="reference external" href="https://timesync.forestry.oregonstate.edu/training/TimeSync_V3_UserManual_presentation.pdf](https://timesync.forestry.oregonstate.edu/training/TimeSync_V3_UserManual_presentation.pdf">https://timesync.forestry.oregonstate.edu/training/TimeSync_V3_UserManual_presentation.pdf](https://timesync.forestry.oregonstate.edu/training/TimeSync_V3_UserManual_presentation.pdf</a>).</p>
<p><strong>LandTrendr</strong></p>
<p>LandTrendr has much the same functionality as TimeSync, but runs in Google Earth Engine. It was created by [Dr. Robert Kennedy]( <a class="reference external" href="https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/people/robert-kennedy">https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/people/robert-kennedy</a>)’s lab with funding from the US Forest Service Landscape Change Monitoring System, the NASA Carbon Monitoring System, a Google Foundation Grant, and U.S. National Park Service Cooperative Agreement. Recent contributors include David Miller, Jamie Perkins, Tara Larrue, Sam Pecoraro, and Bahareh Sanaie (Department of Earth and Environment, Boston University). Foundational contributors include Zhiqiang Yang and Justin Braaten in the Laboratory for Applications of Remote Sensing in Ecology located at Oregon State University and the USDA Forest Service’s Pacific Northwest Research Station.</p>
<p>From Kennedy, R.E., Yang, Z., Gorelick, N., Braaten, J., Cavalcante, L., Cohen, W.B., Healey, S. (2018). Implementation of the LandTrendr Algorithm on Google Earth Engine. Remote Sensing. 10, 691.:</p>
<p>&gt; “LandTrendr (LT) is a set of spectral-temporal segmentation algorithms that are useful for change detection in a time series of moderate resolution satellite imagery (primarily Landsat) and for generating trajectory-based spectral time series data largely absent of inter-annual signal noise. LT was originally implemented in IDL (Interactive Data Language), but with the help of engineers at Google, it has been ported to the GEE platform. The GEE framework nearly eliminates the onerous data management and image-preprocessing aspects of the IDL implementation. It is also light-years faster than the IDL implementation, where computing time is measured in minutes instead of days.”</p>
<p>From LandTrendr’s documentation, here’s an example output in the GUI. However, LandTrendr has significant non-GUI data analysis capabilities. For a comprehensive guide to running LT in GEE visit: [<a class="reference external" href="https://emapr.github.io/LT-GEE/landtrendr.html">https://emapr.github.io/LT-GEE/landtrendr.html</a>]( <a class="reference external" href="https://emapr.github.io/LT-GEE/landtrendr.html">https://emapr.github.io/LT-GEE/landtrendr.html</a>).</p>
